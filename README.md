Welcome to my GitHub page! Let's get started on knowing a little more about me first.
I am ***(learning more to become)*** a solo game developer. I'm currently learning different skills like music creation, art designing, story designing, programming, audio design, etc. I use the Godot game engine and have developed a few different projects with it. Here's some examples. I've also started making Android apps as something new to keep me learning about new things.

### More About Me
I have tons of hobbies and talents/tricks up my sleeve. For example, I've taught myself how to play some very basic piano, how to program, how to film, and more. I love some gaming in my spare time if i'm not coding. Speaking of which, I code all day, every day. I usually never back away from programming and get super immersed into it. And I've heard being a lazy programmer pays off, which is exactly what I am!

### Recent News
Recently, I've joined the [ArcOS](https://github.com/Izk-ArcOS) team and we do some pretty neat stuff there! Check it out! I work there as a part of the core team. I work on some design, I work in ArcTerm and I also help beta test for them. There's also a **[ REDACTED ]** on the way for the ArcOS team and maybe the general public at some point. I highly suggest you check it out sometime soon.

### Languages I Know
I know English, and some simple German and Spanish. But for programming, I know some Java, Python, C++, Kotlin, and GDScript. I understand how to write all of those but basic compared to anyone elses abilities.
