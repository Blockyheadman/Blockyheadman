Welcome to my GitHub page! Let's get started on knowing a little more about me first.
I am ***(learning more to become)*** a solo game/software developer. I'm currently learning different skills like music creation, art designing, story designing, programming, audio design, etc.
I use the Godot game engine and have developed a few different projects with it. Here's some examples. I've also started making Android apps as something new to keep me learning about new things.

### More About Me
I have tons of hobbies and talents/tricks up my sleeve. For example, I've taught myself how to play some very basic piano, how to program, how to film, and more.
I love some gaming in my spare time if i'm not coding. Speaking of which, I code all day, every day.
I usually never back away from programming and get super immersed into it.

### Recent News
I've starting getting more in depth with C++ in private repos. Eventually when these projects are more fleshed out, I plan to release them out to the public for the world to see!
I'm not sure when they'll be released, especially since I'm really busy currently but we'll see eventually! :)

### Languages I Know
I know English, and some simple Spanish. But for programming, I know some Java, Python, C/C++, Kotlin, GDScript, and WebDev (HTML/CSS/JS && React/TS).
I understand how to write all of those but basic compared to anyone elses abilities in my opinion.
