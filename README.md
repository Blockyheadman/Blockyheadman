Welcome to my GitHub page! Let's get started on knowing a little more about me first.
I am ***(learning more to become)*** a solo game/software developer.
I'm currently learning different skills like music creation, art designing, story designing, programming, audio design, etc.
I primarily program in just VSCode, but I do use the Godot game engine and have developed a few different projects with it.
Here's some examples. I've also started making Android and SDL apps to keep me learning about new things.

### More About Me
I have tons of hobbies and talents/tricks up my sleeve.
For example, I've taught myself how to play some very basic piano, some simple play-by-ear, how to program, how to film, photograph, and more.
I love some gaming in my spare time if i'm not coding. Otherwise, I'm either learning from others about programming or working on some side project.
I usually never back away from programming once I get started and get super immersed into it.

### Recent News
Slowly working to get back into programming things again.
Taken a huge hiatus after losing interest in working on my projects, but now I feel I could start working on some projects from the backlog.
[Code Golf](https://code.golf) has been a good helper in bringing me back to programming again after so long.
Maybe I can finally make some old projects public!
